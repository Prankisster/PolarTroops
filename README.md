Plan:
First we get the user's location. Then based on the user's location we suggest him to choose the places that he would like to visit within a 50 km radius, from a dropdown menu. After that we would like to suggest a schedule of how to visit all those places in the shortest time, while also suggesting restaurants and other attractive spots nearby.
